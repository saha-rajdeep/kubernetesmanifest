## What this does?
This repo along with https://github.com/saha-rajdeep/kubernetescode creates a Jenkins pipeline with GitOps to deploy code into a Kubernetes cluster. CI part is done via Jenkins and CD part via ArgoCD (GitOps).
Follow along with my Udemy Kubernetes course lectures (GitOps Chapter) to understand how it works, detailed setup instructions, with step by step demo. My highest rated Kubernetes EKS discounted Udemy course link in www.cloudwithraj.com

Please refer to the https://github.com/saha-rajdeep/kubernetescode/blob/main/README.md for the instructions on how to use the codes.
